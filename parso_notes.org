* TODO Exclusion should be done via interceptors

    Rather than exclude modules at init time, we should exclude them using the interceptor system.

* TODO Re-enable interceptors

* TODO All tests need to pass

* TODO use `module-path` in all canned test configs.

* TODO If we run init on an existing session, we generally get a constraint violation because we're deleting work items with results. We need to fix "clear" so that it deletes results first.

* TODO Verify that celery tests work

* TODO I think the worker is leaving mutations in place when there is a segfault.

  The tests need to execute in a separate process from the worker code that mutates the code.
