* TODO Update docs

* TODO Do we have secret deployment credentials in the travis config?!

* TODO Multi-anchor issue
  We have an issue where multiple anchors could, in principle, cause a WorkItem
  to be skipped. We need to account for that in the spor interceptor. Currently,
  if it tries to add multiple work results for the same work item it fails. We
  need an "update result" or "set result" API on the work db. 

* TODO worker not reverting changes in all cases

  I've seen adam.py left in a corrupt state when killing execution
  and/or celery executors...not sure where the culprit is.

  I think this is related to sigint/sigkill where we don't get a chance to clean
  up.

* Need to thread python version down to parso calls

* Adding "not" doesn't seem to add a space. E.g. "x is 3" becomes "x is not3".

FOR LATER

* TODO Re-enable comparison operator replacement "special rules"

* TODO Exclusion should be done via interceptors

    Rather than exclude modules at init time, we should exclude them using the interceptor system.

* TODO Remove test-runner plugins from pypi?

* TODO Add "command line" command for producing a command line
  Don't forget to update _print_item to use this.
 
* TODO celery worker must limit self to one process!

  We can't let celery start up multiple "threads" else it'll collide with itself.

* TODO Consider alternatives to celery

  rq: https://github.com/rq/rq

 * TODO Verify that celery tests work

 * TODO Consider using interceptors to skip operator replacements that we want to avoid.
