* TODO Exclusion should be done via interceptors

    Rather than exclude modules at init time, we should exclude them using the interceptor system.

* TODO Re-enable interceptors

* TODO Re-enable all oeprators

    These largely need to be rewritten, so do them one at a time.

* TODO All tests need to pass

* TODO Remove faffing around with sys.path. 
  It seems unnecessary now.

* TODO Counting

* TODO use `module-path` in all canned test configs.

* TODO If we run init on an existing session, we generally get a constraint violation because we're deleting work items with results. We need to fix "clear" so that it deletes results first.
