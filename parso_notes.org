* TODO Store mutation ranges in WorkItem

  Right now we store line number and column-offset for each workitem, but this doesn't tell us the full
  extent of the mutation. We should store start-(line,col) and stop-(line,col), and we can get this
  from parso nodes.

  We should modify work item to store this. We should then modify the operator API so that
  instead of reporting "num mutations" it instead reports an iterable of (start-{line,col}, stop-{line,col})
  tuples. Update the database to store this. Then we can use this to do spor exceptions.

* TODO Exclusion should be done via interceptors

    Rather than exclude modules at init time, we should exclude them using the interceptor system.

* TODO Re-enable interceptors

* TODO All tests need to pass

* TODO Verify that celery tests work

* TODO Remove test-runner plugins from pypi?

* TODO Add "command line" command for producing a command line
  Don't forget to update _print_item to use this.
  
* TODO Add an "apply" command for applying a mutation to code on disk

* TODO Do we have secret deployment credentials in the travis config?!

* TODO Use apsw in workdb
