* TODO Exclusion should be done via interceptors

    Rather than exclude modules at init time, we should exclude them using the interceptor system.

* TODO Update docs

* TODO All tests need to pass

* TODO Verify that celery tests work

* TODO Remove test-runner plugins from pypi?

* TODO Add "command line" command for producing a command line
  Don't forget to update _print_item to use this.
  
* TODO Do we have secret deployment credentials in the travis config?!

* TODO test_e2e.py is failing apparently because it's launching pytest using python2.

  We need to somehow ensure that the pytest that runs is the right one, i.e. the one
  belonging to the current environment.

  Perhaps we need to interpolate sys.executable into the command if it's requested.

  I've implemented this...need to update the conf files, and make a note of it somewhere.

* TODO Multi-anchor issue
  We have an issue where multiple anchors could, in principle, cause a WorkItem
  to be skipped. We need to account for that in the spor interceptor. Currently,
  if it tries to add multiple work results for the same work item it fails. We
  need an "update result" or "set result" API on the work db. 

* TODO Re-enable comparison operator replacement "special rules"

* TODO worker not reverting changes in all cases

  I've seen adam.py left in a corrupt state when killing execution
  and/or celery executors...not sure where the culprit is.

* TODO celery worker must limit self to one process!

  We can't let celery start up multiple "threads" else it'll collide with itself.
